# Hi I'm Dylan! #

## About Me ##
👋 Hi there! I'm Dylan Dizon, a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary and a proud participant in the Science Co-op Program. Originally from the Philippines, I’ve been calling Canada home since 2015.

🚀 I'm passionate about solving problems and creating meaningful digital experiences. Whether it's building full-stack web applications or exploring the depths of Python programming, I’m always looking to challenge myself and learn something new. Lately, I’ve been expanding my skills in Web Development, Firebase, and Django, while diving into the mathematics behind Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through self-study.

🎓 As a co-op student, I value hands-on learning and collaborative development. I’ve led and contributed to various real-world projects, from museum management systems to secure password apps, and I’m always seeking opportunities to grow through building.

🎸 When I'm not buried in code, you'll find me strumming my guitar. Music has been a big part of my life since I was young, and it's my way of unwinding and expressing myself. 

💡 I'm excited to continue exploring the world of tech, connect with like-minded developers, and build projects that make an impact. Let’s connect and create something awesome together!
