# Hi I'm Dylan! #

## About Me ##
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Dylan Dizon, a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary. Originally, I'm from the Philippines, but I've been calling Canada home since 2015. 

ðŸŒŸ I'm really into figuring things out and making cool stuff with computers. From writing code to building programs, I'm always eager to dive into new challenges. Right now, I'm currently diving deeper into Python Programming, and Web Development, trying to expand my knowledge and skills by building projects that I am passionate about. I'm also very interested in mathematics, and I am currently enjoying self-learning the mathematics behind Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

ðŸŽ¸ When I'm not buried in code, you'll find me strumming my guitar. Music has been a big part of my life since I was young, and it's my way of unwinding and expressing myself. 

ðŸš€ I'm excited to keep learning and growing in the world of technology. Every day is a chance to discover something new and push myself further. I'm eager to connect with others who share my passion and see how we can collaborate to create amazing things together. Let's chat and explore the possibilities!

#### Toy Store App GUI ####
**What?**
- Developed a Toy Store application with a text file database management capabilities, including features for adding, removing, and tracking toys, where each toy has unique serial numbers, prices, and stock levels.
- Structured and implemented the backend framework to ensure scalability and maintainability of the application, while applying the MVC architecture to organize each class.
- Implemented a Logging class for real-time activity within the application, alongside GUI enhancements for improved user interaction, robust input validation for data integrity, and seamless data persistence through database integration
- Conducted unit tests on components, including valid toys in the database, to ensure quality assurance
**How?**
- The main language for the backend is Java, which provides a strong and versatile foundation for the application's core logic and functionality. For the frontend, XML and Scene Builder were utilized, enabling a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. 
- For testing, JUnit was the primary tool utilized, providing a robust framework for writing and running repeatable tests. It facilitated the creation of comprehensive test cases, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code.
